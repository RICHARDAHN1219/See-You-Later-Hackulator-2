Hackulator Hackathon Codes 

This is LifeHacker, a mobile productivity app gamified with in-app currency and purchases that the user earns by completing their daily tasks and roles in order to not only promote productivity but also a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction in getting things done and receiving continuous incentives. LifeHacker is for people who struggle to achieve their goals and tend to have no motivation or drive behind using a productivity app without excitement, which brought us to an idea of making productivity exciting and feel rewarding. The users own coins in the app and can use it to exchange it for whatever gifts they decide for themselves at prices they set when making the task, which is up to the user’s discretion in terms of gaining coins. The main components involved a home page with a login, task page, and a rewards page. The task page is where all the tasks would be listed out and there’s an option to make new tasks through a pop-up with sections to input the title, task category, date, and time, and the number of coins to receive once the user completes the task they make. The rewards page is where specific rewards can be inputted at various prices in exchange for the user’s own currency. The reasoning behind this is so that the user can develop better habits in scheduling their lives and how much they invest their time and energy in when there is always an incentive driving them
